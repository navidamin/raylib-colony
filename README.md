## Colony

![$(Game Title)](screenshots/screenshot000.png "$(Game Title)")

### Description

**Colony** is a strategic resource management and expansion game set on an untamed, resource-rich planet. Players begin with a single **Sect** on a vast, alien landscape, using an **Extraction Unit** to gather essential resources and gradually build out their first colony. Over time, players unlock and build new **Units** like **Farming**, **Energy**, **Manufacturing**, and **Research**â€”each with unique parameters and upgrades. 

The gameplay unfolds across multiple scales:
- **Planet View** shows the broader environment, complete with resource maps and colony positions.
- **Colony View** lets players oversee the entire operation, connecting **Sects** with roads and monitoring colony growth.
- **Sect View** zooms in on a single Sect's **Core** and Units, where detailed management of each Unit's output and upgrades takes place.

There is no endgame, only endless expansion. As players develop their technology, explore the planet, and establish connections between **Colonies**, they must strategize around resource depletion, efficient transport, and technological upgrades. Their ultimate goal is to grow from a single struggling **Sect** into a sprawling, interconnected network of Colonies thriving across the planet.
