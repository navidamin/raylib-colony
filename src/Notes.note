DONE- clony should also have inPlanet and Incolony draw


DOUBT - sect() constructor should take in the position which is gotten from the mouse position when creating

write in the fix draw claude chat to create a differnet class for UI

in Planet view sects are not clickable ( then how can player swtich betwen colonies?)

After developed activeness of more than 2 units:
    try removing non-active unit indicator circles from colony and planet view
    and, draw unit indicator circle proportionate to unit development


Extract Unit Development
    each resource type has a sldier with discrete values from 0 to 10 that shows the speed by which that resource is extracted/depleted

Each unit has certain modules that has a definite function: consumes A[] consumptions
                                                            generates B[] productions
    each unit has a basic module. next modules are made by upgrades
    each module has 5 levels. from level 1 to level 5 the resource consumption speed decreases nd product generation speed increases
    each level of each module require certain amount of resources (other than the raw material:ENerGy, SCIenctific.breakthroug, MANpower, )

DONE Define consumptions<Resource, rate> and productions<Resource, rate> for each unit
for extraction: productions are the raw material and rates are depandant on efficiency of the extraction unit
for farming consumptions are H2, O2, C and productions is food, water
for energy consumptions are at basic module is nothing but at FuelCell module is H2

DONE only one module is active at time. however player can switch  back to an older module at anytime

the member Unit::Inquiry is a struct {resource, amount, process ("building" "upgardin"), requesterModule, requesterUnit } that contains the resources and the required amount.
each (build, upgrade, ...) creats a struct of this sort and uses Unit::sendInquiry() to add to the Unit::Inquiries queue
void Unit::sendInquiry() registers the inquiries in Unit::Inquiries one by one and adds to the  Unit::Inquiries queue .
void SecT::recollectInquiries() reads Unit::Inquiries from units one by one and fills out a queue for inquiries of all
units: sectInquiries( vector<unit, Inquiry> )
void processInquiries()
void answerInquiries()
A set of function in Sect class to collecct inquiries for resources from units. then it takes some
ticks to deliver and the deliver;
map<resource, amount> Unit::Inquiries
void calculateInquiries()
a function for unit to calcualte the inquires for the next  day and save them in Inquiries to be read by Sect

DONE DischargeResoources() : calcualte the consumptio nof the uit fo one day and keep it and discharge the rest

DONE Debug: sect positions should not be around the edges!
